\section{Applications of Grothendieck duality}
\label{section:applications-grothendieck-duality}
Due to time constraints, both in preparing these notes and actually lecturing about them, the following list of applications is not as worked out as I want it to be.

\subsection{The yoga of six functors}
\label{subsection:six-functors-yoga}
The notion of Grothendieck duality that we have seen so far is in the following situation:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (quasi)coherent sheaves;
  \item Zariski topology for schemes;
\end{enumerate}
But one can consider other contexts too. In the study of \'etale cohomology we have:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item torsion sheaves;
  \item \'etale topology for schemes;
\end{enumerate}
and in the case of manifolds and locally compact spaces we have Poincar\'e--Verdier duality:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item sheaves of abelian groups;
  \item locally compact spaces.
\end{enumerate}

In formalising the properties that are similar in each of these contexts we see that
\begin{itemize}
  \item we are considering ``image functors of sheaves'';
  \item we are using the monoidal structure of the category of sheaves.
\end{itemize}
In the general situation of abstract Verdier duality we can identify the following functors, for~$f\colon X\to Y$ a morphism in some category, and~$\mathcal{C}(X)$ some category of sheaves associated to~$X$.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
    \toprule
    notation & name & signature \\\midrule
    $f^*$ & inverse image & $f^*\colon\mathcal{C}(Y)\to\mathcal{C}(X)$ \\
    $f_*$ & direct image & $f_*\colon\mathcal{C}(X)\to\mathcal{C}(Y)$ \\
    $f_!$ & exceptional (or proper, or twisted) direct image & $f_!\colon\mathcal{C}(X)\to\mathcal{C}(Y)$ \\
    $f^!$ & exceptional (or proper, or twisted) inverse image & $f^!\colon\mathcal{C}(Y)\to\mathcal{C}(X)$ \\
    $\HHom(-,-)$ & internal Hom & $\mathcal{C}(X)\times\mathcal{C}(X)\to\mathcal{C}(X)$ \\
    $-\otimes-$ & internal tensor product & $\mathcal{C}(X)\times\mathcal{C}(X)\to\mathcal{C}(X)$ \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

We have relationships between these functors. These are the adjunctions
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $f^*\dashv f_*$;
  \item $f_!\dashv f^!$;
  \item $-\otimes C\dashv \HHom(C,-)$.
\end{enumerate}
In the situation of Grothendieck duality we moreover have the adjunction (with some abuse of notation, dropping~$\RRR$)
\begin{equation}
  f_*\dashv f^!
\end{equation}
if~$f\colon X\to Y$ is a proper map between the correct type of schemes. Or rather, we have~$f_*=f_!$ in this situation. But in general these are different, so we really have six functors and not just five. In the case of \'etale cohomology these six (or four) functors are also interesting to interpret, for which one is referred to \cite{milne-etale-cohomology}.

\subsection{The moduli of curves}
The paper that introduced \emph{stacks} to the world \cite{deligne-mumford-irreducibility-moduli-of-curves} also applies Grothendieck duality right from the start. The goal is to study the \emph{moduli space~$\mathcal{M}_g$ of curves of genus~$g$}, and show that it is irreducible, regardless of the choice of base field.

As they say themselves, the ``key definition of the whole paper'' is:
\begin{definition}
  Let~$S$ be any scheme. Let~$g\geq 2$. A \emph{stable curve of genus~$g$} over~$S$ is a proper flat morphism~$\pi\colon C\to S$ whose geometric fibres are reduced, connected, $1$\dash dimensional schemes~$C_s$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $C_s$ has only ordinary double points;
    \item if~$E$ is a non-singular rational component of~$C_s$, then~$E$ meets the other components of~$C_s$ in more than~$2$ points;
    \item $\dim\HH^1(\mathcal{O}_{C_s})=g$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
So two aspects of Grothendieck duality come to mind: the relative situation, and the (mild) singularities. We get a canonical invertible sheaf~$\omega_{C/S}$ on~$C$, which will act as a \emph{family} of sufficiently nice curves to connect any two points in the moduli space, thus proving irreducibility. One then proves the following properties of the dualising sheaf:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\omega_{C/S}^{\otimes n}$ is relatively very ample for~$n\geq 3$;
  \item $\pi_*(\omega_{C/S}^{\otimes n})$ is locally free of rank~$(2n-1)(g-1)$.
\end{enumerate}
The proof of these properties uses the fact that we ``almost'' get a smooth curve of genus~$g$, and we study the different irreducible components, together with the explicit manifestation of Grothendieck duality for curves with at most ordinary double points.

Hence we can conclude that, taking~$n=3$, we can realise a stable curve~$C\to S$ as a family of curves inside~$\mathbb{P}^{5g-6}$ such that the Hilbert polynomial of each point is~$(6n-1)(g-1)$.

This yields the construction of a subscheme~$\mathrm{H}_g\subseteq\mathrm{Hilb}_{\mathbb{P}^{5g-6}}^{(6n-1)(g-1)}$ of \emph{tricanonically embedded stable curves}, i.e.\ the functor described by
\begin{equation}
  \Hom_{\mathrm{Sch}}(S,\mathrm{H}_g)\cong\left\{ \left( \text{$\pi\colon C\to S$ stable; $\Proj\left( \pi_*(\omega_{C/S}^{\otimes 3}) \right)\cong\mathbb{P}_S^{5g-6}$} \right) \right\}/{\cong}
\end{equation}
for a scheme~$S$. By taking the quotient of the (open locus of smooth curves of the) scheme~$\mathrm{H}_g$ by the~$\mathrm{PGL}_{5g-6}$\dash action we obtain a model for the moduli space of (smooth) curves, and hence we can try to compute things.

From this point on the proof does not use Grothendieck duality anymore, so I will end the summary here.


\subsection{Other applications}
Each of the following applications more than deserves a proper treatment, but unfortunately this is not possible here. It is here to show how diverse applications of Grothendieck duality can get.

\paragraph{Local duality}
The study of local rings and singularities leads to working with Cohen--Macaulay rings and modules, and understanding these in as concrete terms as possible. It is related to representation theory as well.

\paragraph{Fourier--Mukai transforms}
By using the formalism of the six functors one can work with Fourier--Mukai transforms, which are an analogue of the usual Fourier transforms, but now for derived categories of sheaves on smooth projective varieties. A really nice introduction to this subject is \cite{huybrechts-fourier-mukai}.

\paragraph{Arithmetic geometry}
The relative formalism also applies to arithmetic geometry, for example in studying Eisenstein ideals \cite{mazur-modular-curves-eisenstein-ideal}.


\section{Hartshorne's proof: dualising and residual complexes}
\label{section:hartshorne}
\subsection{Context}
\label{subsection:context}
The first proof of Grothendieck duality was given by Robin Hartshorne in 1966 \cite{hartshorne-residues-and-duality}, based on notes provided by Alexander Grothendieck in 1963. As the statement and proof require the use of derived categories, Jean--Louis Verdier's ongoing work was included, and it was (as far as I can tell) the first published treatise of derived categories.

This approach is the most geometric of them all, but also the most complicated. To quote Amnon Neeman \cite{neeman-grothendieck-duality-bousfield-brown}:
\begin{quote}
  [\ldots] Since derived categories are basically unsuited for local computations, the argument turns out to be quite unpleasant.
\end{quote}
If one reads the proof as outlined in \cite{hartshorne-residues-and-duality} this will become clear: after introducing the required notions of derived categories in algebraic geometry (the first 100 pages) the proof takes 250 pages. These 250 pages also and only summarise many important results on local cohomology and depend heavily on technical results in the EGA's.

Moreover, the proof from \cite{hartshorne-residues-and-duality} is incomplete, and contains errors. Regarding the incompleteness the author himself says in \cite[\S II.5]{hartshorne-residues-and-duality}:
\begin{quote}
  Now these examples are only three of many more compatibilities which will come immediately to the reader's mind. I could make a big list, and in principle could prove each one on the list. [\ldots] And since the chore of inventing these diagrams and checking their commutativity is almost mechanical, the reader would not want to read them, nor I write them. [\ldots]
\end{quote}
Hence the reader is left with checking lots of commutative diagrams.

And there is an important omission from the proof: the compatibility of the trace map for smooth morphisms with arbitrary base change. If~$f\colon X\to Y$ is a proper, surjective, smooth map of schemes whose fibers are equidimensional of dimension~$n$, then we had the \emph{trace map} \cite[\S VII.4]{hartshorne-residues-and-duality}
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_f\colon\RR^nf_*(\omega_{X/Y})\to\mathcal{O}_Y
\end{equation}
which is an isomorphism if~$f$ has geometrically connected fibers. Now let
\begin{equation}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    X' \arrow{r}{v} \arrow{d}{g} & X \arrow{d}{f}Â \\
    Y' \arrow{r}{u} & Y
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
be a cartesian diagram, then we get an isomorphism
\begin{equation}
  u^*\left( \RR^nf_*(\omega_{X/Y}) \right)\to\RR^ng_*\left( v^*(\omega_{X/Y}) \right)\cong\RR^ng_*(\omega_{X'/Y'}).
\end{equation}
The desired compatibility then asserts that
\begin{equation}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    u^*\left( \RR^nf_*(\omega_{X/Y}) \right) \arrow{rr}{\cong} \arrow{rd}{u^*(\gamma_f)} & & \RR^ng_*(\omega_{X'/Y'}) \arrow{ld}{\gamma_{g}} \\
    & u^*(\mathcal{O}_Y)=\mathcal{O}_{Y'}
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
is a commutative diagram. A nice discussion of the state of this base change compatibility can be found in \cite[\S 1.1]{conrad-grothendieck-duality-and-base-change}. To summarise: it has never been proved (it is left to the reader in \cite[\S VII.4]{hartshorne-residues-and-duality}), and its proof is highly non-trivial.

This brings us by \cite{conrad-grothendieck-duality-and-base-change}: this book is written as a complement to the original proof, providing information on the omissions and fixing the numerous mistakes in the original proof. As the theory of derived categories was in its infancy, many things were still unclear, and this caused errors. Some of these are trivial to fix, others are severe and require a completely different proof.

\section{Deligne's proof: the right adjoint}
If one wishes to settle for a Grothendieck duality theory, without dualising and residual complexes, it is possible to prove the existence of the right adjoint~$f^!$ by other means \cite{deligne-appendix,verdier-twisted-inverse-image-functor}. One can then show that the remaining aspects of Grothendieck duality follow from the existence of this adjoint.
